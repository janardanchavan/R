# Scatter Plot
Scatter diagrams or plots  provide a graphical representation of the relationship of two continuous variables.

### Positive Correlation
If x increases y also increases, it is called as positive correlation.
1. Strong Positive Correlation - If dots are tightly bounded to the straight line.
2. Moderate Positive Correlation - Data points are slightly loosly scattered.
3. Poor Positive Correlation - Data is more slightly loosly scattered.

#### Negative Correlation
If x increases y reduces, it is called as negative correlation.

#### No Correlation
If x and y are scattered, it is called as no correlation.
