# Scatter Plot
1. Scatter diagrams or plots  provide a graphical representation of the relationship of two continuous variables.
2. <strong>Be Careful - </strong>Correlation is not cause and effect relationship.
3. Judge strength of relationship by width and tightness of scatter.

### Positive Correlation
If x increases y also increases, it is called as positive correlation.
1. Strong Positive Correlation - If dots are tightly bounded to the straight line.
2. Moderate Positive Correlation - Data points are slightly loosly scattered.
3. Poor Positive Correlation - Data is still slightly loosly scattered.

### Negative Correlation
If x increases y reduces, it is called as negative correlation.
1. Strong Negative Correlation - If dots are tightly bounded to the straight line.
2. Moderate Negative Correlation - Data points are slightly loosly scattered.
3. Poor Negative Correlation - Data is still slightly loosly scattered.

### No Correlation
If x and y are highly scattered, it is called as no correlation.

# Correlation Analysis
Correlation Analysis measures the  degree of linear relationship between two variables.<br/>
It is denoted by small 'r' and called as `correlation coefficient`<br/>
* Range of correlation coefficient (-1 to 1)
* Perfect positive relationship (+1)
* Perfect negative relationship (-1)
* No Linear relationship (0)

If the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.85, then we say there is a good relationship.<br/>
If the r value is > +0.85, it is called as strong positive relationship<br/>
If the r value is > -0.85, it is called as strong negative relationship
* Example: r = 0.87, r = -0.9, r-0.9, r=0.9, r=-0.87 describe good relationship

If the r value is between 0.65 to 0.85, it is called as Moderate Positive correlation or Average Positive correlation.
If the r value is between -0.65 to -0.85, it is called as Moderate Negative correlation or Average Negative correlation.

If  the r value is less than 0.65, then it is called as Poor Positive correlation.
If  the r value is less than -0.65, then it is called as Poor Negative Correlation.
* Example: r = 0.5, r = -0.5, r = 0.28 describe poor relationship
