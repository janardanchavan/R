#### Normal Distribution
Normal distribution is  also called as symmetrical distribution.
* Bell shaped curve
* 50% data lies at the left of virticle line i.e. Mean and 50% data lies at the right of virticle line
* any normal distribution/random variable value takes values between -infinity to +infinity <br/>
   i.e. anything that occurs naturally on this plannet would be always between -infinity to +infinity
* the probability that a normal random variable X <strong>equals</strong> any particular value is 0
* The total area under the normal curve is equal to 1

Probability formula: P() = I.E. / Total Events

The probability associated with any single random variable is always 0, because we are interested in only one random event.
Ex. What is the probability of the climate of being 25.6 degree => 0%.

Standard Normal Distribution:
* A Normal Distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called as Standard Normal Distribution.
* Any x value can be transformed into  a z-score by using the formula `Z = (Value - Mean) / (Standard Deviation) = (x-µ) / σ

Example data:

| Emp No | Salary | Work Exp. |
| --- | --- |
| 123 | 450000 | 2 |
| 314 | 650000 | 3.5 |
| 423 | 850000 | 5.3 |

Why Standard distribution?
* to make the data unitless
* to resolve scalling issue
