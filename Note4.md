### Normal Probability Plot / Normal Distribution plot / Q-Q Plot / Symmetrical Curve

To identify if the data is distributed normally or not. 
If data points are around in a single diognal line, it means data is following normal distribution.

Plot vs Curve for normal distribution:
If someone asks to plot a normal distribution curve, draw it like a bell shaped graph.
If someone asks to plot a normal distribution plot, draw it like a scatter graph with line.

### Sampling variation

* Statistics vary from Sample to Sample due to randomness.
* A population of 1000,000 people has an average IQ of 100.
* Suppose if you take sample of 5 people will it be same as 100 or what you will get?

### Confidence Interval

* What is the Probability of a student scoring 65.5% in an Examination?
Probability is '0' (because probability associated with any single value is 0)

What does below line mean?
I am 95% confident that I will score 75% to 85% in an exam.

Note:
Z-Score for 95% confidence is 1.96
Z-Score for 95% confidence is 1.64
Z-Score for 95% confidence is 2.58
