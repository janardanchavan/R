### Normal Probability Plot / Normal Distribution plot / Q-Q Plot / Symmetrical Curve

To identify if the data is distributed normally or not. 
If data points are around in a single diognal line, it means data is following normal distribution.

Plot vs Curve for normal distribution:
If someone asks to plot a normal distribution curve, draw it like a bell shaped graph.
If someone asks to plot a normal distribution plot, draw it like a scatter graph with line.

### Sampling variation

* Statistics vary from Sample to Sample due to randomness.
* A population of 1000,000 people has an average IQ of 100.
* Suppose if you take sample of 5 people will it be same as 100 or what you will get?

### Confidence Interval

* What is the Probability of a student scoring 65.5% in an Examination?
Probability is '0' (because probability associated with any single value is 0)

What does below line mean?
I am 95% confident that I will score 75% to 85% in an exam.

Note:
Z-Score for 95% confidence is 1.96<br/>
Z-Score for 90% confidence is 1.64 (1.64 / 1.65)<br/>
Z-Score for 99% confidence is 2.58 (2.57 / 2.575/ 2.58)<br/>

Case Study with respect to Credit Card:
* A Bank with 50,000 customers is thinking of offering a <br/>
new credit card to its all customers.

* Profitability of the card depends on the average balance <br/> 
maintained by the card holds.

* A Market research campaign is launched, in which about<br/>
200 customers accept the card in a promotional campaign.

* Average balance maintained by these is $1,650 and the<br/>
standard deviation is $1,987. Assume that the population<br/>
standard deviation is $1,500 from previous launches.

* What we can say about the average balance that will be <br/>
held after a full-fledged market launch?

Population = N = 50,000
Sample = s = 200
S.Mean = \Xbar = 1650
S.SD = \s = 1987
P.SD = \sigma = 1500
what will be population mean? = \mu = ???
