### Measures of Dispersion
#### 2nd moment of Business decisions

disperse means spread
dispersion - measure of dispersion / measure of variations

The mean, median or mode is usually not by itself a sufficient measure to reveal the shape of adistribution of a data set. 
We also need a measure that can provide some information about the variation among data set values.

The measures that help us to know about the spread of a data set are called `measures of` dispersion.

The measures of central tendency and dispersion taken together give a better picture of a data set.

We consider 3 measures of dispersion:
1. Range
2. Variance
3. Standard Deviation

Variance - The measure of variation among the datapoints is called as variance.

Population variation is always denoted by Greek notation - \sigma^2
Sample variation is always denoted by English notaton - \s^2
